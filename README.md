# Area Under the Graph Calculator
This is a program I wrote as a Grade 12 Computer Science student to calculate the area
a specified graph.

The program is based on the mathematical idea of Riemann sums, used to introduce math
students to integrals. 

It is not fully functioning and it only works when you run it on the Ready to Program IDE

Feel free to make any changes and have fun calculating the area under graphs.
